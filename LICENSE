By Lightricks Ltd. (“Lightricks”)
RAIL-M License 
dated November 22, 2024
Section  I:  PREAMBLE
Multimodal generative models are being widely adopted and used, and have the potential to transform the way artists, among other individuals, conceive and benefit from artificial intelligence (“AI”) or ML technologies as a tool for content creation. Notwithstanding the current and potential benefits that these artifacts can bring to society at large, there are also concerns about potential misuses of them, either due to their technical limitations or ethical considerations.
The development and use of AI does not come without concerns. The world has witnessed how AI techniques may, in some instances, become risky for the public in general. These risks come in many forms, from racial discrimination to the misuse of sensitive information.
This RAIL-M License is generally applicable to any machine-learning Model (as defined below). The “RAIL” nomenclature indicates that there are use restrictions prohibiting the use of the Model. These restrictions are intended to avoid potential misuse by not permitting the use of the Model in very specific scenarios, in order for the licensor to be able to enforce the license in case a potential misuse of the Model may occur. Even though derivative versions of the Model could be released under different licensing terms, the License (as defined below) specifies that the use restrictions in the original License must apply to such derivative versions. This License governs the use of the Model (and its derivatives) and is informed by the model card associated with the Model.
NOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows:
1. Definitions 
   1. “Complementary Material” means the applicable source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc, if any. Complementary Material is not licensed under this License.
   2. “Contribution” means any work of authorship, including the original version of the Model and any modifications or additions to that Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Model by the rights owner or by an individual or legal entity authorized to submit on behalf of the rights owner. For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Model, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the rights owner as “Not a Contribution.” 
   3. “Contributor”  means Licensor and any individual or legal entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Model.
   4. “Data” means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the dataset used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License. 
   5. “Derivatives of the Model” means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model, including – but not limited to – distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for training the other model.
   6. “Distribution” means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means – e.g. API-based or web access. 
   7. “Harm” includes but is not limited to physical, mental, psychological, financial and reputational damage, pain, or loss.
   8. “License” means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in this document.
   9. “Licensor” means the rights owner or entity authorized by the rights owner that is granting the License, including the persons or entities that may have rights in the Model and/or distributing the Model. For the purposes of this License, the Licensor is Lightricks Ltd.
   10. “Model” means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the Lightricks’ Model “LTX Video 0.9” model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part on the Data, using the Complementary Material. 
   11. ”Output” means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom. 
   12. “Permitted Purpose” means for academic or research purposes only, and explicitly excludes commercialization such as downstream selling of the Model or Derivatives of the Model. 
   13. “Third Parties” means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with Licensor or You.
   14. “You” (or “Your”)  means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application – e.g. chatbot, translator, image generator.
Section II:   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Both copyright and patent grants apply to the Model and Derivatives of the Model. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III, which shall govern the use of the Model and Derivatives of the Model even in the event Section II is held unenforceable.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Model and Derivatives of the Model, only for the Permitted Purpose.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and where and as applicable, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Model and/or Derivatives of the Model, but only for the Permitted Purpose. Such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Model or Derivatives of the Model to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Model or Derivative of the Model and/or a Contribution incorporated within the Model or Derivative of the Model constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for the Model and/or Derivative of the Model shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed.
Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION
4. Distribution and Redistribution. You may host for Third Party remote access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service), reproduce and distribute copies of the Model or Derivatives of the Model thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, provided that You meet the following conditions:
